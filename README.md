# ChangingEarth
What if we could make a game that simulate physically the human activity on Earth with atmospheric simulation and a real war game between the players.

## Install the ARPS model
The core of the game will be based on atmospherical simulations
After unpacking arps5.2.12.tar, create the executable following these command:  
cd arps5.2.12  
./makearps -io nohdf arps  
./makearps -io nohdf arps_mpi
